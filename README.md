# Car Crash Analysis: A Data-Driven Approach to Road Safety

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance road safety by analyzing car crash patterns using big data techniques. We leverage the Car Crash Dataset (CCD) from Kaggle ([Car Crash Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asefjamilajwad/car-crash-dataset-ccd)) to:

- Identify objects and vehicle behavior within video frames.
- Analyze crash patterns using Apache Spark and MongoDB.
- Visualize crash data using Power BI.

## Key Questions:
- What are the trends in crash occurrences?
- How do environmental factors influence crash likelihood?

## Future Directions:
- **AI Integration**: Incorporate advanced neural networks, predictive analytics, and deep learning.
- **Infrastructure Advancement**: Utilize 5G, IoT sensors, and cloud computing for real-time data processing.
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Develop predictive maintenance systems and behavioral analysis models.

By understanding crash patterns and leveraging data-driven insights, we can contribute to safer roads and reduce the number of traffic accidents.
